Problem Statement:
Create a payment service to accept credit card , debitcard , paypal, cryptopayment

lessons to learn:
using an interface
creating implementation classes of the interface
learn about loosely couping classes.

tightly coupling - pre defined behavior for child classes
behavior and attributes already defined and initialzied in parent class. they may need to be overwritten in child class


loosely coupling:
behavior and attributes are declared in interface class and they are defined in the implementation classes.
interfaces mainly just use behaviors aka methods
